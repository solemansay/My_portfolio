                        <p>
                            Hey there! My name is Soleman Sayeed, I am currently a student at UNC Charlotte. I was born
                            in Canada and raised all over the
                            world, I have lived in 8 countries and counting! I was raised in a big family of 7
                            constantly moving from city to city, school to
                            school. I believe this is the reason that I have such good communication skills and have no
                            problem going into a large group of
                            people and sparking conversation.
                            The reason that I wanted to learn how to code stems from my teen years of playing videogames
                            and trying to figure out how they
                            work. My first experience with coding was running mods on Minecraft and trying them with my
                            friends. Since I started learning more
                            I feel a larger hunger got coding knowledge than ever before!
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            I have many hobbies that I do outside of coding and video games, many of them including outdoor
                            activities such as hiking, camping skiing, snowboarding,
                            water skiing/wakeboarding, and biking. I love to
                            travel more than anything else experiencing new and exciting cultures, eating new foods and
                            seeing the most beautiful parts of our world.
                            This passion of mine is a big reason why coding from home on my laptop is the perfect career for
                            me. I also love to play my guitar and read
                            to relax and unwind.
                        
                        </p>
